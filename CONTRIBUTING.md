If you want to help improve an ebuild in this overlay, I gladly accept pull
requests. So, go over to GitHub and fork this repository:

[https://github.com/fritteli/gentoo-overlay](https://github.com/fritteli/gentoo-overlay)

Then change whatever you want and send me the pull request. If you want, you can
also create an issue along with it. But you don't have to.

Thank you for your help!
