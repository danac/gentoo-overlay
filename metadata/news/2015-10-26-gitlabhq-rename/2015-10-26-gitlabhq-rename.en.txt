The package www-apps/gitlabhq will be renamed to www-apps/gitlab-ce in
the near future (mid-november 2015 or so). The rename should not have
any impact on your installed GitLab instance, as all installation paths
will remain the same as before.

Please make sure to update your /etc/portage/package.* files, though,
if that doesn't happen automatically.

If you feel that such a rename is inappropriate, or that it will cause
too much unnecessary trouble, please open an issue on Github at

Thank you.
