GitLab 8.2.0 introduces some bigge changes that may require your attention
when upgrading:
- gitlab-git-http-server was renamed to gitlab-workhorse. Accordingly,
  dev-vcs/gitlab-git-http-server has been renamed to
  dev-vcs/gitlab-workhorse. The old package still exists, though, because
  it is still needed by <gitlab-ce-8.2. The two packages can not be
  installed simultaneously. Therefore, before upgrading, you may need to
  manually unmerge gitlab-git-http-server.
- If you're using CI, please note that you must upgrade
  dev-vcs/gitlab-ci-multi-runner to version 0.7.1.

As always, backup your database before upgrading. And be sure to read the
GitLab upgrade guide at

Thank you.
